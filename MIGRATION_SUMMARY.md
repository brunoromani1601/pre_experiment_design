# Migration Summary: Monolithic to Modular Structure

## Overview
Successfully migrated the experiment design tool from a single monolithic file (`experiment_design_tool.py`) to a modular, class-based structure for better maintainability and code organization.

## Migration Details

### Before (Monolithic Structure)
- **Single file**: `experiment_design_tool.py` (986 lines)
- **All functionality**: Mixed in one file
- **Difficult to maintain**: Hard to find specific functionality
- **No separation of concerns**: UI, business logic, and utilities all together

### After (Modular Structure)
```
├── experiment_design_tool.py          # Main application entry point
├── experiment_design_tool_backup.py   # Original file backup
├── core/                              # Business logic modules
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── calculator.py                  # SampleSizeCalculator class
│   ├── pdf_generator.py              # PDFGenerator class
│   └── session_manager.py            # SessionManager class
├── components/                        # UI page modules (renamed from 'pages' to avoid Streamlit auto-detection)
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── experiment_designer.py        # Experiment designer page
│   └── sample_calculator.py          # Sample size calculator page
└── ui/                               # UI styling and components
    ├── __init__.py
    └── styling.py                    # Custom CSS styling
```

## Key Benefits

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- **Core Logic**: Business logic separated into dedicated classes
- **UI Components**: Each page is a separate module
- **Styling**: CSS styling isolated in its own module

### 2. **Maintainability**
- **Easier to find**: Specific functionality is in dedicated files
- **Easier to modify**: Changes are isolated to specific modules
- **Easier to test**: Individual components can be tested separately

### 3. **Reusability**
- **Core classes**: Can be imported and used in other projects
- **Modular pages**: Can be easily added, removed, or modified
- **Styling**: CSS can be reused across different components

### 4. **Scalability**
- **New features**: Can be added as new modules
- **Team development**: Multiple developers can work on different modules
- **Code review**: Easier to review smaller, focused files

## Migration Process

### Phase 1: Core Classes Extraction
1. **SampleSizeCalculator**: Extracted statistical calculation methods
2. **PDFGenerator**: Extracted PDF generation functionality
3. **SessionManager**: Created new class for session state management

### Phase 2: UI Components Separation
1. **Sample Calculator Page**: Extracted to `components/sample_calculator.py`
2. **Experiment Designer Page**: Extracted to `components/experiment_designer.py`
3. **Styling**: Moved CSS to `ui/styling.py`

### Phase 3: Main Application Refactor
1. **Updated imports**: Main file now imports from modular components
2. **Simplified structure**: Main file is now just 36 lines vs 986 lines
3. **Clean navigation**: Sidebar navigation remains unchanged

### Phase 4: Streamlit Multi-Page Fix
1. **Directory rename**: Renamed `pages/` to `components/` to prevent Streamlit's automatic multi-page detection
2. **Updated imports**: Changed import paths from `pages.*` to `components.*`
3. **Clean sidebar**: Now only shows custom navigation dropdown without default Streamlit page options

## File Size Comparison

| Component | Before | After | Reduction |
|-----------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Main file | 986 lines | 36 lines | 96% |
| Core logic | Mixed | 196 lines | Separated |
| UI pages | Mixed | 764 lines | Separated |
| Styling | Mixed | 50 lines | Separated |

## Testing Results

✅ **All imports successful**: Modular components import correctly  
✅ **Functionality preserved**: All features work exactly as before  
✅ **Session state**: Properly managed through SessionManager  
✅ **PDF generation**: Works with modular PDFGenerator  
✅ **Sample calculations**: All statistical methods preserved  
✅ **Clean navigation**: Only custom dropdown visible, no default Streamlit elements  

## Usage

The application works exactly the same as before:

```bash
streamlit run experiment_design_tool.py
```

No changes to user experience - all functionality preserved while improving code organization.

## Future Enhancements

With the modular structure, future enhancements become much easier:

1. **New pages**: Add new files to `components/` directory
2. **New core features**: Add new classes to `core/` directory
3. **UI improvements**: Modify `ui/styling.py` for styling changes
4. **Testing**: Individual modules can be unit tested
5. **Documentation**: Each module can have its own documentation

## Backup

The original monolithic file is preserved as `experiment_design_tool_backup.py` for reference or rollback if needed.
