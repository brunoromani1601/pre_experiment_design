# Migration Summary: Monolithic to Modular Structure

## Overview
Successfully migrated the experiment design tool from a single monolithic file (`experiment_design_tool.py`) to a modular, class-based structure for better maintainability and code organization.

## Migration Details

### Before (Monolithic Structure)
- **Single file**: `experiment_design_tool.py` (986 lines)
- **All functionality**: Mixed in one file
- **Difficult to maintain**: Hard to find specific functionality
- **No separation of concerns**: UI, business logic, and utilities all together

### After (Modular Structure)
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Modular Architecture**
- **Separation of concerns**: Business logic, UI, and utilities are separated
- **Reusable components**: Classes can be imported and used independently
- **Easier testing**: Individual components can be tested in isolation
- **Better maintainability**: Changes to one component don't affect others

### 2. **Enhanced Functionality**
- **Post-Experiment Analysis**: New component for analyzing completed experiments
  - Supports both binary (app rate) and continuous (revenue/EPL) metrics
  - Dynamic test selection (superiority vs non-inferiority)
  - Statistical and practical significance assessment
  - Interactive visualizations with Plotly
  - Comprehensive recommendations

### 3. **Improved User Experience**
- **Clean navigation**: Three main components accessible via dropdown
- **Consistent styling**: Unified CSS across all components
- **Better organization**: Logical grouping of related functionality

### 4. **Technical Improvements**
- **Session management**: Centralized state management
- **Error handling**: Better error handling and validation
- **Code reusability**: Shared utilities and styling
- **Dependency management**: Updated requirements with new dependencies

## Component Details

### Core Modules (`core/`)
- **`calculator.py`**: Sample size calculations for various test types
- **`pdf_generator.py`**: PDF report generation functionality
- **`session_manager.py`**: Centralized session state management

### UI Components (`components/`)
- **`experiment_designer.py`**: Pre-experiment design and planning
- **`sample_calculator.py`**: Sample size and power calculations
- **`post_experiment_analysis.py`**: Post-experiment results analysis

### UI Utilities (`ui/`)
- **`styling.py`**: Custom CSS for consistent styling across components

## New Features Added

### Post-Experiment Analysis Component
- **Dynamic test selection** based on metric type and experiment type
- **Statistical analysis** for both binary and continuous outcomes
- **Practical significance** assessment using MDE
- **Power analysis** (achieved vs. planned power)
- **Interactive visualizations** with confidence intervals
- **Clear recommendations** for implementation decisions

## Migration Benefits

### For Developers
- **96% reduction** in main file size (986 → 36 lines)
- **Easier debugging**: Issues can be isolated to specific components
- **Faster development**: New features can be added as separate components
- **Better code organization**: Clear structure and naming conventions

### For Users
- **Enhanced functionality**: New post-experiment analysis capabilities
- **Improved navigation**: Clear separation between pre and post-experiment tools
- **Better visualizations**: Interactive charts and graphs
- **Comprehensive analysis**: Both statistical and practical significance

## Future Enhancements
- **Additional statistical tests**: Chi-square, ANOVA, etc.
- **More visualization options**: Time series, funnel analysis
- **Export capabilities**: Excel, CSV, additional PDF formats
- **Advanced analytics**: Bayesian analysis, sequential testing
- **Integration capabilities**: API endpoints for external data sources

## Technical Notes
- **Dependencies**: Added plotly for interactive visualizations
- **Compatibility**: Maintains all existing functionality
- **Performance**: Improved loading times through modular imports
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new components and features
